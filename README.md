# Capstone Project 2

# Project Title: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

## Project Overview
This Data Analysis Project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. By exploring the customer data and analysing the various parameters, I seek to understand customer behaviour, track subscription types and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. This would help make data-driven decisions and enable me tell a unique story with the insights gotten from the data.
